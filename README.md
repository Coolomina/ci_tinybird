# CI Flows for Tinybird Data Projects

A collection of configuration files that enable CI flows for Tinybird data projects.

## ⚡️ Quick start

These configuration files have been created to iterate your Tinybird data projects using CI & CD jobs.

**Please, follow this [guide](https://www.tinybird.co/docs/guides/working-with-git.html) for connecting your repository to your Tinybird data project.**

For the moment, we provide CI/CD configuration files for [GitLab](https://github.com/tinybirdco/ci/blob/main/.gitlab) and [GitHub](https://github.com/tinybirdco/ci/blob/main/.github).
