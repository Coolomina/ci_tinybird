# Iterating your Tinybird data projects with a GitLab repository

These are the steps to follow:

1. Define these CI/CD variables in your repository:

    - `ADMIN_TOKEN` (required): the admin token from your Tinybird workspace
    - `TB_HOST` (optional): in case your Tinybird workspace isn't in EU region
    - `DATA_PROJECT_DIR` (optional): in case your data project is located in a folder and not in the main root

> You can add them in the `Settings >> CI/CD >> Variables` section, and "Add variable"

2. Follow the [`Working with git`](working_with_git_guide_url) guide
3. Done ðŸŽ‰
